												The <b>TechHOUNDS</b>, <b>Team 868,</b> is Carmel High School's <i><b>FIRST</b></i> Robotics Team, with approximately sixty students and fifteen mentors who eagerly look forward to FIRST's new game every year. We pride ourselves on being a <b>student-managed team</b> that works hard to build a primarily student-constructed robot. After build season, we participate in <b>two regional competitions</b>, one of which being the Purdue Boilermaker Regional, and in certain years we have a chance to attend the <b>Atlanta International Championship</b>. This is all possible through our <b>involved members and skilled engineers</b>. Many of our team members have parents who return year after year, even when their students graduate, to serve as mentors and volunteers on the team as well. This is not simply an extra curricular activity in which students pass the time - it is a <b>close-knit</b>, <b>team-driven organization</b> in which students and adults alike learn new skills with technology, and even more importantly, the importance of <b>good sportsmanship</b>, <b>gracious professionalism</b>, and <b>teamwork</b>. <b>Team 868</b> provides a learning experience that is not only rewarding, but one that <b>builds character</b> and <b>changes lives</b>.

												In 1992, <i><b>FIRST</b></i> began offering challenging opportunities at the beginning of every year in the form of exciting games. Not only did this foster technical skills, but it encouraged the development of <b>teamwork</b>, <b>entrepreneurship</b>, and <b>gracious professionalism</b>. From the time this team was created by an existing mentor in the <b>2001-2002 season</b>, we have always followed these ideals. We hope to keep the tradition of being a <b>student-run team</b> and having all of our seniors <b>graduate from high school on to college</b>. This year is our team's <b>ninth year</b> in the competition, and we are certainly looking forward to many more exciting seasons!<hr>

												For maximum efficiency, our team is structured into <b>six major divisions</b>, each responsible for a different aspect of the team. Students are, of course, allowed to "float" between any of the branches of interest, as long as each student is aware of his/her responsibilities and assignments. Each division has <b>its own manager</b>, while everything is overseen by overarching Team Leaders. Our <b>business-like structure</b> ensures that <b>individual tasks</b> are accompished to ultimately complete a <b>common goal</b> during the build season.<br><br>Click <a href="../branches/branches.html">here</a> to see the details of each branch.<hr>

												During the build season, Team 868 holds all meetings at the <b>CHS Industrial Technology Department</b>. We are fortunate to have a well-equipped <b>machine shop</b>; a <b>print shop</b>; a <b>construction room</b> where the playing field is built; <b>computer labs</b> for programming, animation, and website; and allowance to hold parent meetings in other areas of the school. We not only have a fantastic physical environment, but an environment of <b>friendliness and teamwork</b>. Some students are tutored by fellow members and mentors, as it is a <b>standard</b> that all students who travel must earn a grade of C or better. Everyday we look out for the best interest of each other and our goals.<hr>
