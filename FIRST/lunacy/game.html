<hr><p align="center"><a name="overview"><font size=4 color=orange><b>Overview</b></p></font></a><p align="justify">On January 3, 2009, FIRST unveiled its annual challenge to thousands of teams worldwide. Drawing inspiration from the <b>40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing</b>, this game features aspects of space exploration, presenting new hurdles never faced before by FRC competitors! Whereas in years past the field was made of carpet, this game is played on a 54' x 27' <a href="#field"><b>low friction field</b></a> made from special fiberglass termed "regolith". Robots must be driven on hardened plastic wheels that, when on the “crater”, simulate the driving of rovers on the moon in one-sixth gravity! The robots will also have scoring containers attached on the back of themselves called <b>"trailers"</b>. Two three-team robot alliances collect and score Orbit Balls (or <a href="#score">game pieces</a>) in trailers attached to the opposing teams’ robots during the <b>two-mintute and fifteen-second match</b>, and human players are positioned around the perimeter of the arena to score from their stations. The object of the game is to score the most points, which would be the sum total of all game pieces in the opponents’ trailers.</p><hr></td></tr>
