												On January 9, 2010, FIRST unveiled its annual challenge to thousands of teams worldwide. 
												The goal of the game is simply to score as many soccer balls (or <a href="#score"><b>game pieces</b></a>) into your goals 
												as possible in <b>two minutes and fifteen-seconds</b>, along with an added game-play twist at the end. 
												Balls are not allowed to be possessed (carried or held), so each robot will need to push, 
												kick, or corral the balls across the field. Each game will be played with two alliances of 
												three robots each, so competition and cooperation will both be crucial on the field. This 
												cooperation is most evident in the finale of each match, where bonus points can be scored for either 
												hanging off of your teams tower, worth two goals, or off of an allied robot who is already hanging off
												of the tower, worth three (<a href="#periods"><b>game periods</b></a>).  This years 27 by 54 <a href="#field"><b>field</b></a>, made of carpet, has two sharply inclined 
												speed bumps, dividing the field into thirds, with tunnels in the center of each speed bump. This means 
												that each robot will need to be able to either climb the bumps or fit through the 18 tall tunnel if
												they want to move to different sections of the field. A hanging guardrail system is also part of the
												field, allowing balls to be returned to play after they are scored. A human player uses a device 
												called a trident to lift the ball onto the guardrail system.
